# AT3 Progress: Growing a Digital Garden Through Communities and Mycelial Thinking


As I near the completion of my AT3 project - the Mycelial Garden - I want to reflect on how this journey has embodied the very concepts it seeks to visualize. What started as a simple idea for an interactive garden has grown into something much more profound: a living demonstration of how creativity spreads through networks, both digital and human.

## The Garden Takes Root

My Mycelial Garden has evolved from a basic Three.js sketch into a fully-realized collaborative ecosystem. Currently featuring:
- Real-time collaborative planting (WebSocket-ready architecture)
- Underground mycelial networks that visualize connections between plants
- A 25-plant cycle that celebrates collective achievement
- Global participation mechanics showing gardeners from different countries
- Dynamic audio landscape that responds to growth

But the technical features are just the fruiting body of something deeper...

## Communities of Practice: The Human Network

### Domain: Where Digital Art Meets Ecology

The **domain** of this project exists at a fascinating intersection:
- Creative coding communities (Three.js developers, WebGL artists)
- Digital ecology movements (artists exploring natural systems through code)
- Collaborative art spaces (net.art communities, shared virtual worlds)
- Educational technology (making complex systems visible and interactive)

What I've discovered is that my project speaks multiple languages - it's code to programmers, art to designers, and a meditation on interconnection to everyone else.

### Repertoire: Shared Tools and Techniques

Throughout development, I've drawn from a rich **repertoire** of community resources:

**Technical Repertoire:**
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) documentation and examples
- [WebSocket](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WebSockets_API) patterns from multiplayer game development
- Particle system techniques from the demoscene
- Generative music approaches from live coding communities

**Conceptual Repertoire:**
- Mycelial network visualizations from scientific illustration
- Collaborative mechanics from MMO games
- Aesthetic choices from kawaii culture and contemporary net.art
- Growth algorithms from procedural generation communities


### Values: What We Grow Together

The **values** embedded in the project reflect those of multiple communities:

1. **Transparency**: Like live coding's "show us your screens," all code is visible
2. **Accessibility**: No installation required, runs in any browser
3. **Collaboration**: Individual actions benefit the collective
4. **Sustainability**: The garden cycles, never depleting
5. **Beauty in Connection**: Aesthetic emerges from relationships, not isolation

### Brokering: Cross-Pollinating Ideas

The most exciting part has been **brokering** between communities:

- Bringing Three.js technical skills to ecological artists
- Introducing game mechanics to data visualization
- Connecting live coding's improvisational spirit with careful garden planning
- Bridging single-player creative coding with multiplayer thinking

The WebRTC/WebSocket planning specifically emerged from brokering between:
- Real-time collaboration tools (Google Docs paradigm)
- Multiplayer gaming architectures
- Peer-to-peer philosophy from decentralized web movements

## Mycelial Creativity: How the Project Grows

### Omnidirectional Growth

Like mycelium, this project hasn't grown linearly. Features spread in all directions:

- **Aesthetic tendrils**: From basic spheres to organic curved stems to glowing particle effects
- **Technical rhizomes**: WebGL to Web Audio to WebSockets to potential WebRTC
- **Conceptual spores**: Garden → Network → Ecosystem → Global Collaboration

Each session of development sent out new threads, exploring what's possible. Some withered (early attempts at realistic plant physics), while others flourished (the underground network visualization).

### Accumulative Growth

The project demonstrates **accumulative growth** through:

1. **Code accumulation**: Each feature builds on previous work
   - Basic Three.js scene → Plants → Connections → Network visualization
   - Simple sounds → Musical scales → Generative compositions

2. **Conceptual accumulation**: Ideas layer and compress
   - Individual plants → Connected plants → Network strength → Global consciousness

3. **Community accumulation**: Feedback and inspiration compound
   - Discord suggestions → GitHub examples → Tutorial remixes → Original innovations


### Transformational Growth

The most profound **transformational growth** has been conceptual:

**Week 1**: "I'll make a cute garden where you can plant flowers" <br/>
↓ <br/> 
**Week 2**: "What if the plants connected underground?" <br/>
↓ <br/>
**Week 3**: "This could visualize how communities actually work" <br/>
↓ <br/>
**Week 4**: "This is a living metaphor for collective creativity itself"

The code transformed too, from procedural spaghetti to organized classes ready for real networking. But more importantly, my understanding transformed: this isn't just an assignment, it's a statement about how creativity actually works.

### Fruiting Body: What Emerges

The visible garden with its golden connections and floating spores, is the **fruiting body** of an underground process. Beneath the surface:

- Hours of learning Three.js through community tutorials
- Conversations about mycelial networks in nature
- Research into collaborative digital spaces
- Experimentation with generative music systems
- Wrestling with WebSocket architectures

The 25-plant bloom celebration isn't just a game mechanic, it's the moment when accumulated underground growth suddenly becomes visible, celebrating what we've built together.

## Current Challenges & Next Growth

As I refine the project, I'm navigating:

1. **Performance optimization**: Too many particles affect some devices
2. **True multiplayer**: Moving from simulation to real WebSocket implementation
3. **Accessibility**: Ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader support
4. **Mobile experience**: Touch controls and responsive design

But these aren't obstacles, they're all nutrients for the next phase of growth.

## Reflection: The Network Is the Garden

What I've learned is that the true Mycelial Garden isn't the one on screen, it's the network of communities that made it possible. Every Stack Overflow answer, every Three.js example, every musical inspiration is a node in the real network.

My code commits are like spores, released into the open-source ecosystem. Someone might fork this project, add their own features, and continue the growth in directions I never imagined. That's the beauty of mycelial creativity - it doesn't need a single author or direction.
