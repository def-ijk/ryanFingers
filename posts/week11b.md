# AT3 Progress: Growing a Digital Garden Through Communities and Mycelial Thinking


As I near the completion of my AT3 project - the Mycelial Garden - I want to reflect on how this journey has embodied the very concepts it seeks to visualize. What started as a simple idea for an interactive garden has grown into something much more profound: a living demonstration of how creativity spreads through networks, both digital and human.

## Communities of Practice concepts:

**Domain:** Positioned at intersection of creative coding, digital ecology, and collaborative art.<br />
**Repertoire:** Detailed the shared tools, techniques, and knowledge drawn from various communities.<br />
**Values:** Identified 5 core values embedded in the project.<br />
**Brokering:** Explained how the project bridges different communities.


## Mycelial Creativity concepts:

**Omnidirectional growth:** Showed how features spread in aesthetic, technical, and conceptual directions.<br />
**Accumulative growth:** Demonstrated through code, concepts, and community feedback.<br />
**Transformational growth:** Traced the evolution from simple garden to profound metaphor.<br />
**Fruiting Body:** The visible garden as emergence from underground learning processes.<br />
