It seems like he uses vertex shaders to randomly displace geometry, glitched textures or UV maps, or postprocessing effects like scanline artifacts. The core technique might be breaking the normal rendering pipeline to simulate "corruption." Glitching a 3D form disrupts my expectations of solidity and spatial logic, creating a tension between structure and chaos. This heightens effective complexity, making the piece feel both unstable and richly detailed. It evokes digital decay, error, or virtual collapse, which is unsettling but compelling.
