# Rafael Rozendaal and "Into Time"
Rafael Rozendaal is a contemporary visual artist whose work exemplifies the post-digital aesthetic. One of his most well-known works, "Into Time" (2010â€“present), is a generative browser-based artwork that exists purely on the web. The piece features shifting gradients and layered color transitions that respond to user interaction in real time, forming an ever-evolving composition.

According to Florian Cramer's essay What is Post-Digital?, post-digital art is less about the novelty of digital technology and more about integrating it so deeply into our lives that it becomes mundane or invisible. Cramer defines post-digital practices as those which critically engage with digitality while embracing hybrid media, physicality, and a rejection of the "new media" spectacle.

## Rozendaal's "Into Time" fits into the post-digital framework for several reasons:
<ol>
<li>It exists on the web, but with painterly qualities which flattens the distinction between physical and digital art.</li>

<li>It is generative and interactive, rejecting fixed forms.</li>

<li>It de-emphasizes technology itself, the code becomes invisible to the viewer, as the work focuses on experience rather than technical display.</li>
</ol>

## Technology used:
Rozendaal typically uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to build his interactive pieces, hosting them as individual domains such as [intotime.com](https://www.intotime.com/). The technology is minimal and web-native, reinforcing Cramer's point that post-digital art isn't defined by cutting-edge tools, but by context and integration.

## Tech stack:

**Canvas API:** for low-level drawing of color shapes and gradients.

**p5.js:** for more expressive generative visuals.

**gsap:** for smooth animation timing.

**RiTa.js:** for generative language integration, which could add poetic captions or titles dynamically, turning visual abstraction into hybrid digital-literary art.
