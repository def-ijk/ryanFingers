# Inclusion as a Structural Pillar of Creative Coding

Creative coding risks becoming another tool of techno-feudalist oppression unless we recognize inclusion as a fundamental structural necessity, not an optional add-on.

Whilst current digital infrastructure reflects its creators' narrow demographics, limiting technology-generating capacity to privileged few. This self-reinforcing cycle excludes marginalized communities from both using and shaping these tools. We must redistribute infrastructure creation to diverse communities.

Traditional coding education emphasizes extrinsic motivations (jobs, salaries) while ignoring intrinsic drives for creative expression. Inclusive creative coding must honor both, allowing learners to see their cultures reflected in computational practices. Computer science gatekeeping—through "weed-out" courses, competitive cultures, and cultural signaling—blocks access. Creative coding can route around these barriers only by actively dismantling the "natural programmer" myth and creating multiple entry points.

Without digital literacy, communities cannot engage with legislation shaping their digital futures. Inclusive creative coding becomes civic engagement, enabling people to create alternatives rather than merely consume policy.

Alos, the vectoralist class controls information flows, turning creators into digital serfs. Network effects and switching costs reinforce these power structures. True inclusion demands open standards, interoperability, and education about resistance. Extra-institutional hubs of knowledge—community centers, maker spaces, informal networks—serve those excluded from formal education. The critical posthumanities remind us these spaces aren't charity cases but essential sources of innovation.

Without inclusion as its foundation, creative coding will reinforce existing hierarchies rather than challenge them. We must reconstruct our practices: redistributing infrastructure, reimagining pedagogies, dismantling gatekeeping, and centering diverse knowledge systems. Finally, the choice is ours: liberation or oppression.
