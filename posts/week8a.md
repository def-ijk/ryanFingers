# 5 communities of practice (CoPs) that I'm a part of: 

## Creative Coding Community
**Domain:** The use of code as a medium for artistic expression, like: gen art, interactive installations.<br>
**Repetoire:** might be generative design techniques, art theory, exhibitions, etc.<br>
**Values:** give me chances to have some experimentation, openness, aesthetic exploration.

## AI Research Community
**Domain:** advances knowledge and applications in AI and machine learning. <br>
**Repetoire:** Some of research papers, coding frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch, datasets and conferences like NeurIPS.<br>
**Values:** obvious innovation, transparency, rigor and problems about ethical responsibility.

## Net Art Community
**Domain:** Internet-based art practices.<br>
**Repetoire:** around HTML, CSS, JS, and conceptual frameworks.<br>
**Values:** centers around accessibility, collaboration and experimentation within digital sphere.

## Activist Designers
**Domain:** Design for public concern for raising awareness and advocacy.<br>
**Repetoire:** runs from emotional storytellingm posters, campaigns and interactive media.<br>
**Values:** returns social impact, empathy, urgency and truth telling

## 3D and WebGl Designers
**Domain:** some 3D interactive spaces, VR and experiences based on WebGL.<br>
**Repetoire:** Blender, Three.js, Unity and Spatial.io.<br>
**Values:** combines immersion, realism and interactivity.

# Creative Coding as CoP
**Domain:** creates expressive and experimental works using code.<br>
**Repetoire:** online libraries like p5.js, shaders, generative visuals and interactive sketches.<br>
**Values:** reflect innovation, creativity, collaboration and sharing knowledge.

# ðŸ§  AT3 brainstorming 
## Code Apocalypse
**Concept:** A web-based generative garden that changes based on live user interaction with each plant is coded uniquely.
It might involve in creative coding, 3D/WebGl designers and net art community.<br>

**Ngai's aesthetic register:** `Cute and Interesting` with visual pleasantness, contemplation, and data-driven beauty. It can be embodied the conceptual desity and reflective quality which Ngai discusses.
