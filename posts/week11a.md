# AT3 Plan: Mycelial Garden - Communities Growing Together

## Community Context

### Domain
The Mycelial Garden exists at the intersection of:
- **Creative Coding Community**: Artists and programmers who use code as their medium
- **Digital Ecology Movement**: Creators exploring natural systems through computational means
- **Collaborative Net Art**: Online spaces where multiple users create together
- **Live Coding Culture**: Real-time, transparent creative processes

### Repertoire
Our shared toolkit includes:
- **Technical Tools**: Three.js for 3D graphics, Web Audio API for generative sound, WebSockets for real-time communication
- **Visual Languages**: Particle systems, organic growth algorithms, network visualizations
- **Interaction Patterns**: Click-to-plant mechanics, hover states, presence indicators
- **Aesthetic Codes**: Kawaii design elements, bioluminescent color palettes, generative animations

### Values
The community embraces:
- **Radical Transparency**: All code visible, all processes shared
- **Collective Creativity**: Individual actions benefit everyone
- **Accessible Beauty**: No barriers to entry, runs in any browser
- **Ecological Thinking**: Systems over objects, connections over isolation
- **Playful Learning**: Serious concepts through joyful interaction

## Code Architecture

### Core Technologies
```javascript
// Three.js for 3D rendering
const scene = new THREE.Scene();
const plants = [];
const mycelialConnections = [];

// WebSocket for real-time collaboration
const ws = new WebSocket('wss://garden-server.example.com');

// Web Audio API for generative soundscape
const audioContext = new AudioContext();
```

### Key Systems

1. **Plant Generation System**
   - Procedural geometry using Three.js curves and meshes
   - 8 unique flower types with randomized characteristics
   - Growth animations using requestAnimationFrame

2. **Mycelial Network Visualization**
   - Dynamic line geometry connecting nearby plants
   - Pulsing energy nodes showing data flow
   - Underground root systems with golden glow effects

3. **Real-time Collaboration**
   - WebSocket messages for plant events
   - Synchronized garden state across all users
   - Presence system showing active gardeners

4. **Audio Ecosystem**
   - Generative background music using Web Audio oscillators
   - Reactive sound effects for planting and blooming
   - Spatial audio based on garden activity

## Practical Implementation

### How It Works

1. **User Arrives**: They see a circular garden with a cute fence, floating spores, and other gardeners' plants already growing

2. **Planting Interaction**: 
   - Click on the ground to plant
   - See immediate visual feedback (particles, growth animation)
   - Hear musical chimes

3. **Network Growth**:
   - Plants within range automatically connect underground
   - Connections strengthen the network (visible percentage)
   - International connections get special effects

4. **Collective Achievement**:
   - At 25 plants, the garden "blooms"
   - Celebratory animation and message
   - Garden resets for next cycle

5. **Continuous Engagement**:
   - See other users planting in real-time
   - Hover to learn about each plant's origin
   - Toggle mycelium view to see hidden connections

### User Journey
```
Enter Garden â†’ See Others' Plants â†’ Add Your Plant â†’ 
Watch Connections Form â†’ Contribute to Bloom â†’ 
Celebrate Together â†’ Begin New Cycle
```

The garden becomes a living visualization of how communities create together - each person's contribution literally connects to and strengthens others, creating emergent beauty that no individual could achieve alone.

# Haiku Iterations

## First Attempt (Technical Focus)
```
Three.js renders light
WebSockets connect our roots
Garden blooms as one
```

## Second Attempt (Community Focus)
```
Click to plant your seed
Underground we interweave  
Twenty-five, we bloom
```

## Third Attempt (Philosophical)
```
Mycelium spreads
Separate plants, connected roots
We fruit together
```

## Fourth Attempt (Action-Oriented)
```
Plant. Connect below.
Your flower strengthens us all.
Bloom at twenty-five.
```

## Final Version (Chosen)
```
Roots glow gold beneath
Each plant deepens our network
Together we bloom
```

This haiku captures:
- The visual element (glowing golden roots)
- The collaborative aspect (our network)
- The collective achievement (together we bloom)
- The mycelial metaphor in just 17 syllables

# Video Production Plan

## Voiceover Script
```
[Soft, contemplative voice]

Roots glow gold beneath...
Each plant deepens our network...
Together we bloom.
```

## Video Structure
1. Slow zoom into empty garden  
2. First plant appears, roots spread underground
3. Multiple plants connecting, network glowing
4. Final bloom celebration

## Music Selection
Suggested copyright-free tracks:
- "Meditation Impromptu 03" by Kevin MacLeod
- "Ethereal Relaxation" by Borrtex
- "Garden Vibes" by Lukrembo

### ðŸŒ¸ Mycelial Garden: A Haiku Journey


Sometimes the essence of a complex project can be distilled into just seventeen syllables. As I developed my AT3 project - the Mycelial Garden - I challenged myself to capture its spirit in haiku form.

The process of reduction was illuminating. How do you compress:
- Real-time collaborative technology
- Underground network visualizations  
- Community building mechanics
- Ecological metaphors

Into three brief lines?

The answer came through focusing on the experiential rather than the technical. What does it *feel* like to participate in this garden? What do you *see*? What do you *become part of*?

> Roots glow gold beneath  
> Each plant deepens our network  
> Together we bloom

This haiku became my north star - every feature, every line of code, every aesthetic choice should serve this simple truth: we are connected beneath the surface, each action strengthens the whole, and our greatest beauty emerges collectively.

The speed-modulated recording shows the garden's full lifecycle compressed into 20 seconds - the time it takes to speak these three lines. Watch how individual actions accumulate into collective achievement. Notice how the underground network grows more complex and beautiful with each addition.

This is mycelial creativity in its purest form - not in the code or the visuals, but in the moment when separate becomes connected, when individuals become community, when planting becomes blooming.

*What haiku would you write for your creative practice?*
