## Quoted from "Information & Thinking" by Michel Serres
**<em>"Information exists in nature; thinking is not unique to humans."</em>**
<br> This idea is represented through autonomous particles that have their own "thinking" behaviors and patterns, moving through space according to inherent rules.


**<em>"The world is not an object of knowledge but a tissue of relations."</em>**
<br> Visualized through the blue connecting lines between particles that form and break based on proximity, creating a dynamic tissue-like network.

**<em>"Noise is the background of information, the sea from which signals emerge."</em>**
<br> Expressed through the underlying noise field and wireframe mesh that distorts and fluctuates, representing the background from which information particles emerge.
